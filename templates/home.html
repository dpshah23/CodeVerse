                          <p>Frontend development, also known as client-side development, is the practice of producing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a website or web application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with frontend development is that the tools and techniques used to create the frontend of a website change constantly, and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

                        <div class="section">

                          <h3><i class="fab fa-html5 section-icon"></i> HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
                          <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Purpose:</span> HTML is the backbone of any website development process, without which a web page does not exist. HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Example:</span> Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage. It helps in defining where the header, body, and footer of the page are located.
                          </p>
          
                          <h3><i class="fab fa-css3-alt section-icon"></i> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
                          <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Purpose:</span> While HTML structures your content, CSS is what makes your website look good. CSS is a design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Example:</span> CSS is used to apply styles to HTML elements. For instance, you can use CSS to change the color, font, and layout of your web pages. It’s what makes your content visually appealing and adaptable to different devices.
                          </p>
          
                          <h3><i class="fab fa-js section-icon"></i> JavaScript</h3>

                            <span class="key-point">Purpose:</span> JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content that can interact with users. If HTML is the skeleton and CSS is the skin, JavaScript is the muscles.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Example:</span> Use JavaScript to create things like interactive maps, animated graphics, and responsive forms. For instance, when you fill out a form online and get instant feedback (like checking if your email is valid), that’s JavaScript in action.

                          <p>HTML uses tags and attributes to organize the content on the webpage. Tags are the building blocks, and attributes provide additional information about elements.</p>
                          <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Example:</span> <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag for headings,
                            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag for paragraphs, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag for links.

                          <p>CSS provides style rules that define how HTML elements are displayed. It includes layout, color, fonts, and overall visual effects.</p>
                          <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Example:</span> <code>color: red;</code> to make text red,
                            <code>margin: 10px;</code> to create space around elements.
                          </p>
          
                          <h3><i class="fas fa-magic section-icon"></i> Interactivity with JavaScript</h3>
                          <p>JavaScript enables dynamic content and interactive elements on the webpage. It can manipulate HTML and CSS to update the UI, control multimedia, animate images, etc.</p>
                          <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Example:</span>
                            <code>document.getElementById("myElement").innerHTML = "Hello World!";</code> changes the content of an HTML element with the ID <code>myElement</code>.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Example:</span> Using a CSS media query to apply different styles for screen widths below 600px, ensuring a mobile-friendly design.
